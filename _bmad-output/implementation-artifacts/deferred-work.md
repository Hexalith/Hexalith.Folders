# Deferred Work

This file accumulates items deferred from BMAD reviews and audits. Each section is dated and references its source story.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-establish-a-consumer-buildable-module-scaffold (2026-05-11)

- `<InternalsVisibleTo>` entries in `src/Hexalith.Folders.*/*.csproj` point to test assemblies (`Hexalith.Folders.*.Tests`) that didn't exist in commit `eb52d15`; they exist at HEAD as later commits added them. No action needed unless a test project is later removed.
- `Directory.Build.props:23-26` declares MSBuild properties `HexalithEventStoreRoot` and `HexalithTenantsRoot` that nothing currently consumes. Likely placeholders for future-story consumption (e.g., per-project file lists, NuGet feed switching). Revisit when a downstream story imports them.
- Predev preflight gate `result: "fail"` recorded in `predev-preflight-2026-05-10T200403Z.json` and latest pointer due to a dirty working tree (sprint-status + story 1-6 staged). Process concern outside the code-review scope — track via the preflight gate, not in this story.
- `.gitmodules` declares 5 root submodules including `Hexalith.Memories`, but `Directory.Build.props` only detects `Hexalith.EventStore` and `Hexalith.Tenants`. Add a `HexalithMemoriesRoot` detector when a downstream story first references Memories.
- No `Directory.Build.targets` adapted from `Hexalith.Tenants`. Acceptable deviation today; revisit when stories require SourceLink wiring or pack-time MSBuild logic.
