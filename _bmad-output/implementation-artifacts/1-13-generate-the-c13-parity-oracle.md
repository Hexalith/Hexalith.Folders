# Story 1.13: Generate the C13 parity oracle

Status: done

Created: 2026-05-13

## Story

As a maintainer,
I want the C13 parity oracle generated from the Contract Spine,
so that cross-surface tests consume one source of truth for transport and behavioral parity.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the Contract Spine declares parity metadata, when the parity-oracle generator runs, then `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.yaml` is generated from `src/Hexalith.Folders.Contracts/openapi/hexalith.folders.v1.yaml` rather than hand-authored operation rows.
2. Given generated rows are produced, when validation runs, then every row schema-validates against `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.schema.json` and validation fails on missing required transport or behavioral columns.
3. Given the Contract Spine contains mutating commands, when generation runs, then every mutating command has a parity row with `idempotency_key_rule` derived from OpenAPI idempotency metadata and generation fails closed if required mutating metadata is missing.
4. Given the Contract Spine contains non-mutating operations, when generation runs, then every query, status, audit, context-query, and operations-console projection row has `read_consistency_class` and `idempotency_key_rule: not_accepted_for_non_mutating_operation`.
5. Given an operation declares `x-hexalith-parity-dimensions`, `x-hexalith-canonical-error-categories`, `x-hexalith-audit-metadata-keys`, `x-hexalith-correlation`, `x-hexalith-authorization`, idempotency, lifecycle, or read-consistency metadata, when a parity row is generated, then transport columns (`auth_outcome_class`, `error_code_set`, `idempotency_key_rule`, `audit_metadata_keys`, `correlation_field_path`, `terminal_states`) are derived from those declarations or reported as prerequisite drift.
6. Given SDK, CLI, and MCP adapters need behavior beyond REST transport shape, when rows are generated, then behavioral columns (`pre_sdk_error_class`, `idempotency_key_sourcing`, `correlation_id_sourcing`, `task_id_sourcing`, `credential_sourcing`, `cli_exit_code`, `mcp_failure_kind`) are populated from `docs/contract/idempotency-and-parity-rules.md` and the architecture Adapter Parity Contract.
7. Given operation removals can silently break test parity, when generation compares the current Contract Spine to `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml`, then operation identity is `HTTP method + normalized path + operationId`, and added, removed, renamed, request/response schema, status-code, idempotency, read-consistency, and operation-family changes produce deterministic symmetric-drift diagnostics unless an approved deprecation entry exists.
8. Given generated rows are downstream test inputs, when the generator writes `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.yaml`, then row ordering is deterministic by operation ID, array values and diagnostics are sorted where the schema does not require source order, serialization uses stable UTF-8 and LF formatting, wall-clock timestamps are excluded or normalized, and rerunning generation twice produces byte-stable output.
9. Given lifecycle and negative/error cases are needed for downstream conformance tests, when generation runs, then it emits or references golden lifecycle fixtures plus negative/error contract cases for safe denial, idempotency conflict, validation, provider outcome, read-model unavailable, redaction, and state-transition-invalid scenarios.
10. Given parity evidence must remain metadata-only, when rows, diagnostics, examples, and tests are inspected, then diagnostics may name operation IDs, repository-relative source file paths, schema fields, status labels, and bounded category names, but they contain no file contents, diffs, provider tokens, credential material, raw provider payloads, generated context payloads, local filesystem paths, production URLs, tenant data, request/response headers, sampled API bodies, environment values, or unauthorized resource hints.
11. Given `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.schema.json` is currently a seeded row schema, when implementation needs schema changes for final C13 row shape, then schema updates stay backward-auditable, keep adapter and failure-kind enums bounded, and are covered by focused schema tests.
12. Given Story 1.14 owns CI wiring, when Story 1.13 completes, then it may add local generator commands and focused tests, but it does not modify GitHub Actions workflows or release gates.
13. Given Story 1.12 owns NSwag client generation and idempotency helpers, when Story 1.13 consumes operation identities or helper metadata, then it reuses generated operation IDs and helper provenance instead of reimplementing SDK hash construction policy.
14. Given some C3/C4/S-2/C6 values may still be reference-pending, when generation encounters an explicitly reference-pending value, then it carries a bounded `reference_pending` marker only when the source contract names the unresolved decision and the schema allows the marker; otherwise it fails with a clear prerequisite-drift diagnostic. The generator must not invent final policy values or allow unbounded pending markers.
15. Given active contract work may be in progress, when implementation starts, then the developer inspects the current OpenAPI file, contract notes, existing tests, and active Story 1.7 through Story 1.12 artifacts before assuming the operation inventory or metadata names.
16. Given a maintainer changes the Contract Spine, when the local parity oracle is regenerated, then the resulting artifact and diagnostics identify which REST, SDK, CLI, MCP, and UI adapter expectations are present, missing, stale, removed, or reference-pending from one local metadata-only artifact.
17. Given canonical inputs can disagree, when OpenAPI extensions, rule-table documentation, architecture adapter rules, generated SDK helper provenance, schemas, or previous-spine baselines conflict, then generation fails with bounded `prerequisite_drift` diagnostics instead of choosing an implicit winner or inventing fallback policy.

  - [x] Build and document a source-authority matrix before deriving rows: OpenAPI operation metadata owns transport facts, rule tables and architecture own adapter semantics, schemas own allowed row shape, generated SDK helper provenance owns helper identity only, and `previous-spine.yaml` owns removal/deprecation comparison.
  - [x] Fail with metadata-only `prerequisite_drift` when canonical sources disagree or when a required source is missing for a non-reference-pending field.
  - [x] Do not initialize or update nested submodules.
- [x] Implement the parity-oracle generator under the existing tool path. (AC: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17)
  - [x] Replace the placeholder-only `tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/README.md` ownership note with implementation documentation while preserving ownership and non-leakage rules.
  - [x] Add generator source under `tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/` using the repo's .NET conventions unless a smaller script is explicitly justified by existing tooling.

  - [x] Keep generated output metadata-only and synthetic where examples are needed.
- [x] Derive transport parity columns from canonical sources. (AC: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14)

  - [x] Require `Idempotency-Key` and `x-hexalith-idempotency-equivalence` for mutating operations; require no idempotency key for non-mutating operations.
  - [x] Derive `read_consistency_class` from `x-hexalith-read-consistency` for non-mutating operations.
  - [x] Derive `error_code_set` from `x-hexalith-canonical-error-categories` and fail if an operation lacks a bounded category set.
  - [x] Derive `audit_metadata_keys` from `x-hexalith-audit-metadata-keys` or documented operation-rule rows; do not include raw values.
  - [x] Derive correlation field path from the canonical headers and Problem Details fields, preserving `X-Correlation-Id` and `X-Hexalith-Task-Id` semantics.
  - [x] Derive terminal states from lifecycle metadata where available and from bounded lifecycle/status schemas only when the source is explicit.
  - [x] Compare current operations with `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml`; fail removed operations unless the baseline records an approved deprecation window.
- [x] Derive behavioral parity columns without duplicating adapter semantics. (AC: 6, 9, 10, 13)
  - [x] Consume the Adapter Parity Contract from `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` and the stable rule tables in `docs/contract/idempotency-and-parity-rules.md`.
  - [x] Map SDK pre-call failures separately from server-returned Problem Details so pre-SDK and post-SDK errors cannot both apply to one case.
  - [x] Map CLI exit codes exactly to canonical categories: 0 success, 64 client configuration or usage, 65 credential missing, 66 tenant access denied, 67 workspace locked, 68 idempotency conflict, 69 validation error, 70 known provider failure, 71 unknown provider outcome, 72 reconciliation required, 73 not found, 74 state transition invalid, 75 redacted, 1 internal error.

  - [x] Verify source-authority conflicts fail deterministically, including OpenAPI-vs-rule-table mismatch, schema enum mismatch, missing helper provenance where required, and stale or placeholder previous-spine baselines.
  - [x] Maintain an AC-to-test matrix that maps each acceptance criterion to a fixture input, expected generated row or diagnostic, negative case, and test file.

### Review Findings — Round 3 (2026-05-17)

_Generated 2026-05-17 by `/bmad-code-review 1.13` re-review pass (Blind Hunter + Edge Case Hunter + Acceptance Auditor). Reviewed scope: round-2 patches `7c8f176..HEAD` (`5a4fa0f`). Diff: ~945 lines of logic across `Program.cs` (+630), `ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs` (+220), `parity-contract.schema.json` (+38), `previous-spine.yaml` (+157), `README.md` (+17), plus 2393 lines of regenerated `parity-contract.yaml` (scanned for leaks/distribution only)._

#### Decision-needed (resolved 2026-05-17 — reclassified as patches below)

- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] AuthOutcomeClass regression — Resolution: restore priority + delete dead safeDenial branch. Move `authentication_failure` after the `folder_acl_denied`/`tenant_access_denied` checks (or remove it from this column entirely), and delete the comment-only `safeDenial` branch at `Program.cs:454-459`. A2 partial-coverage gap remains documented as future work.
- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] Previous-spine baseline tripwire on additions — Resolution: add "approved addition" baseline-extension mechanism mirroring deprecation. Allow `previous-spine.yaml` to declare an `approved_additions` block; the inventory-match test passes for operationIds listed there. Symmetric with removal/rename/move approval; preserves additive-drift signal.
- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] Generator project absent from `.slnx` — Resolution: add `tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/Hexalith.Folders.ParityOracleGenerator.csproj` to the `/tests/` folder in `Hexalith.Folders.slnx`. `dotnet test Hexalith.Folders.slnx --no-restore` then builds the generator alongside everything else.

#### Patch — Generator correctness

- [x] [Review][Patch] **(from Decision 1)** Restore AuthOutcomeClass priority and delete dead safeDenial branch [Program.cs:454-471] — Move the `authentication_failure` clause out of the `credential_missing` branch so the more specific `folder_acl_denied`/`tenant_access_denied` categories win. Delete the comment-only `safeDenial` block at lines 454-459. Verify by regenerating the oracle and confirming row distribution recovers `folder_acl_denied`, `tenant_access_denied`, `safe_not_found`, and `tenant_authorized` values.
- [x] [Review][Patch] **(from Decision 2)** Add "approved_additions" baseline-extension mechanism [Program.cs ValidatePreviousSpine, previous-spine.yaml schema] — Mirror the approved-deprecation pattern: `previous-spine.yaml` declares an `approved_additions:` block listing operationIds whose addition is sanctioned. `PreviousSpineBaselineMatchesCurrentOperationInventory` then passes when the current spine adds those operations. Update the test, the baseline schema, and the README.
- [x] [Review][Patch] **(from Decision 3)** Add generator project to `Hexalith.Folders.slnx` [Hexalith.Folders.slnx] — Add `<Project Path="tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/Hexalith.Folders.ParityOracleGenerator.csproj" />` under the `/tests/` folder. Verify by running `dotnet test Hexalith.Folders.slnx --no-restore` on a fresh clone (or after `dotnet clean`).
- [x] [Review][Patch] Dead `safeDenial` branch in `AuthOutcomeClass` [Program.cs:454-459] — block reads `operation.Authorization?.SafeDenial`, opens a brace, and falls through with only a comment. Either implement the precedence or delete the stub; leaving it invites a future "fix" that silently changes contract semantics. (Likely subsumed by the AuthOutcomeClass decision above.)
- [x] [Review][Patch] Path-item extensions (`x-*`) crash generator with `unsupported HTTP method` [Program.cs:65-67] — `pathItemReservedKeys` enumerates only `parameters/summary/description/servers/$ref`; any vendor extension (which OpenAPI 3.x explicitly permits at the path-item level) falls through to the `recognizedMethods` check and throws.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `ValidatePreviousSpine` exceptions lack `prerequisite_drift:` prefix [Program.cs:233-280, 289-291] — non-mapping operations, null entries, and missing `method`/`path` scalars throw generic `InvalidOperationException` / `AsMapping` errors. CI gates that grep for `prerequisite_drift:` miss these cases.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `HasApprovedDeprecation` accepts non-YAML-1.2 literals [Program.cs:680-682, `GeneratorConstants.YamlBooleanTrueLiterals`] — `on`, `y`, `yes`, `1` are accepted but were removed from YAML 1.2 (the spec YamlDotNet emits). For a fail-closed drift guard, `approved: 1` (likely a workspace-ID typo) silently blesses removal.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `StripParameterReferenceSuffix` mangles legitimate names [Program.cs `StripParameterReferenceSuffix`] — `AuthorizationHeader` → `Authorization`, `RequestPath` → `Request`. Unconditional suffix-stripping changes downstream `task_id`/`idempotency_key` detection. Strip only when the source `$ref` resolves to `#/components/parameters/<Name>(Header|Parameter|Query|Path)$` and the schema confirms it is a parameter wrapper.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Rename+move dual case falls through to "removed" [Program.cs ~233-280] — an operation that both renames and moves (new operationId at new path) matches neither `currentByRoute` nor `currentByOperationId` and falls through to the generic "removed without approved deprecation" diagnostic, hiding the more specific signal.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `HasParityDimensions`/`HasIdempotencyKey` use `ContainsKey` and accept null values [Program.cs:114, ~580] — `x-hexalith-parity-dimensions: null` (or `x-hexalith-idempotency-key: null`) is treated as "declared", suppressing the `reference_pending` diagnostic without supplying any metadata.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Path key non-scalar / YAML `~` null [Program.cs:53-60] — `AsScalar` throws without `prerequisite_drift:` prefix; YAML null tag `~` flows through as the literal `~` string, producing a route key `get ~` that breaks deduplication.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Path identity collision on trailing slash [Program.cs:52] — `/foo` and `/foo/` normalize identically, so the second `OperationModel` silently overwrites `routeIdentities` while the first remains in the operations list. Surfaces as a confusing `duplicate operationId` later rather than a clean "duplicate path".
- [x] [Review][Patch] `LocateRepositoryRoot` runs eagerly even when `--repository-root` is supplied [Program.cs ~856] — `Dictionary.GetValueOrDefault(key, defaultValue)` eagerly evaluates the default expression, so the walk fires unconditionally and can throw "could not locate" before the user-supplied root is consulted.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Diagnostics sort lacks final tiebreaker [Program.cs:339-341] — `OrderBy(Level).ThenBy(Category).ThenBy(OperationId ?? "")` has no final discriminator; two diagnostics with identical (Level, Category, OperationId) can swap positions between runs, breaking the byte-stable-output guarantee.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `TerminalStates` values not validated against schema regex [Program.cs:382, parity-contract.schema.json] — emitted values include `context_returned`, `audit_returned`, `projection_returned`, `projected`, `accepted`; no test asserts they match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` or any enum. Adding a hyphenated value silently breaks the schema.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `OutcomeMappings`/schema enum drift undetected [Program.cs:983-1034, parity-contract.schema.json `$defs.canonical_error_category`] — generator throws only when an OpenAPI operation references an unmapped category; a schema-enum-only addition has no compile-time/test-time check. The Round-2 `provider_outcome_unknown` removal demonstrates the asymmetry (only the schema was asserted clean, not Program.cs's mapping table).
- [x] [Review][Patch] `Quote` does not reject U+2028/U+2029/lone surrogates [Program.cs `Quote`] — `char.IsControl` misses U+2028 (LINE SEPARATOR) and U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR), both of which break some YAML/JSON consumers. Lone surrogate halves also pass through unchecked. Zero-width chars (U+200B) survive into operation_id and audit keys, defeating the schema regex.

#### Patch — Test correctness

- [x] [Review][Patch] Byte-stability test cannot detect content regressions [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:147-156] — `File.ReadAllBytes(OraclePath).ShouldBe(File.ReadAllBytes(first))` only enforces "committed YAML matches what the generator currently produces". Any code change followed by re-generation produces a passing test even when the output is semantically wrong (which is exactly how the AuthOutcomeClass regression slipped through). Add a small hand-authored golden-master fixture per operation family, or assert a checksum of the canonical (non-regenerable) subset.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Committed-vs-generated byte equality breaks on Windows CRLF checkouts [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:155] — `File.ReadAllBytes(OraclePath)` is compared without LF normalization; no `.gitattributes` in repo root declares `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.yaml` as `text eol=lf`. With Git default `core.autocrlf=true` on Windows, the committed YAML is rewritten to CRLF on checkout, breaking the assertion. Either add a `.gitattributes` entry or normalize line endings in the assertion.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Hung generator process not killed on test timeout [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:339] — `WaitForExit(180_000).ShouldBeTrue()` asserts and exits without `process.Kill(true)` in a `try/finally`. Leaks the child process per timeout, cascades into obj/bin lock failures in subsequent tests.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Async stream readers may not flush before assertions [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:330-341] — after `WaitForExit(timeout)`, calling `BeginOutputReadLine`/`BeginErrorReadLine` does NOT guarantee final-line flush. Use `process.WaitForExitAsync()` or follow the timed wait with a parameterless `WaitForExit()` to drain. Symptom: flaky "should contain 'prerequisite_drift'" failures.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Duplicate-idempotency-fields test anchor uniqueness not enforced [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:178-181] — `Replace(before, after, Ordinal)` mutates EVERY occurrence; if the anchor `- parent_folder_id\n        - request_schema_version` appears in more than one operation, multiple operations are mutated and the diagnostic asserted may come from the wrong one. Use `IndexOf`/`LastIndexOf` and verify uniqueness before mutating.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Parallel test execution races on `dotnet run --no-build` [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:319-340] — xUnit collection parallelism is on by default; concurrent generator invocations can still race on `obj/` locks. Add `[Collection("ParityOracleGenerator")]` with `DisableParallelization = true`, or precompile the generator binary once via a `ClassFixture`.

#### Patch — YAML/IO robustness

- [x] [Review][Patch] `LoadYaml` ignores multi-document streams and empty/BOM-prefixed files [Program.cs:760-770] — `Documents[0]` throws `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` (no `prerequisite_drift:` prefix) for empty inputs; merge keys (`<<:`) into anchored mappings are silently dropped; subsequent `Documents[1+]` are ignored.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Sha256 hash inconsistent with BOM and subject to TOCTOU [Program.cs:333-334] — `NormalizeLineEndings` handles CRLF/CR but does not strip BOM, so BOM-prefixed sources produce different hashes between machines. Also: file is read twice (once via `LoadYaml`, once via `ReadAllText`); concurrent rewrite produces inconsistent hash vs. parsed content. Read once into bytes and derive both views from the same buffer.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Parameter `$ref` resolution misses nested/external/URL-encoded refs [Program.cs:550-554] — `Split('/').Last()` discards file portion for external refs (`common.yaml#/components/parameters/X`), produces empty string for bare `#`, and does not decode `%20`. No validation that the resolved fragment exists in components.
- [x] [Review][Patch] README documents `--allow-empty-baseline` as "downgrades drift to warning" [README.md:17, Program.cs:264-279] — actual behavior is "early-return on empty operations only"; drift detection is disabled, not downgraded. Misleading copy.

#### Defer

- [x] [Review][Defer] `SafeCommentText` insufficient leak guard for diagnostic stream [Program.cs:4071-4082] — deferred, hypothetical: no concrete leak path identified; current diagnostic content is bounded by code that constructs it. Re-evaluate if diagnostic content sources expand.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `--initialize-baseline` silently overwrites without `--force` or backup [Program.cs:3758-3766] — deferred, UX concern, not correctness. Path of least resistance for failing CI is to nuke the baseline; mitigated socially by sprint review, not technically.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `AuditKey` regex does not check duplicate-after-normalization [Program.cs:108-109] — deferred, the lowercase requirement catches mixed-case duplicates; a future audit-key vocabulary change may reopen this.
- [x] [Review][Defer] Argument parser lacks `--` end-of-options sentinel [Program.cs:806-865] — deferred, not exercised; current callers never pass paths starting with `--`.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `NormalizeName` leading separator/digit silently produces invalid names [Program.cs:701-730] — deferred, current OpenAPI does not declare parameters with these shapes.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `read_consistency_class` enum mixes underscore (`not_applicable`) and hyphen (`eventually-consistent`) forms [Program.cs:582-596, parity-contract.schema.json] — deferred, intentional schema choice. Reopen if the schema is harmonized.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `ReadConsistencyClass` extra-keys/scalar-form produces opaque "value not in enum" rather than `prerequisite_drift:` [Program.cs:582-596] — deferred, diagnostic surface improvement only.

#### Dismissed (not surfaced above)

- "YAML methods canonicalization audit" (Blind Hunter L1) — vague, no concrete failure mode.
- "Adapter expectations reorder churn" (Blind Hunter L2) — cosmetic; ordering is now stable.
- "ReadEnum coerces null to empty string" (Edge Case Hunter E25-adjacent) — test helper, narrow scope, no production data path.

#### Decision-needed (resolved 2026-05-17 — reclassified as patches below)

- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] SDK/Client scope leak — Resolution: document as Story 1.12 follow-up (commit 7c8f176 SDK changes belong to Story 1.12 area). See patch P-23.
- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] Behavioral parity derivation — Resolution: implement full per-category derivation from rule tables now. See patch P-24.
- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] Previous-spine baseline — Resolution: capture current OpenAPI as first baseline. See patch P-25.
- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] Canonical category naming — Resolution: `unknown_provider_outcome` is canonical; remove `provider_outcome_unknown` from schema enum and strip the silent rewrite. See patch P-26.
- [x] [Review][Decision→Patch] Diagnostics block — Resolution: implement minimal `diagnostics: []` block now. See patch P-27.

#### Patch

- [x] [Review][Patch] `task_id_sourcing` and `HasIdempotencyKey` silently miss `$ref` parameters [Program.cs:+3041,+3137-3146,+3150-3152] — refs like `#/components/parameters/TaskIdHeader` normalize to `task_id_header`, never `task_id`; legitimate non-mutating ops declaring `idempotencyKey`-like params get misclassified.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `read_consistency_class` mixes underscore and dash separators [Program.cs:+3156-3158] — `not_applicable` for mutating vs `eventually-consistent` for non-mutating in the same column; force-conversion is unilateral.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `Quote` only escapes `'` — tabs/newlines/control chars/backslashes pass through [Program.cs:+3264] — malformed operationId or audit-key value can break the emitted YAML; byte-stability test cannot catch malformed-but-stable output.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `HasApprovedDeprecation` only matches string `"true"` [Program.cs:+3209-3212] — YAML-native `approved: true`/`yes`/`on`/`1` are silently treated as un-approved → spurious removal failures.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `NormalizePath` collapses `//` and doesn't strip trailing `/` [Program.cs:+3220-3229] — corrupts URL-shaped paths; harmless trailing-slash drift between current and previous spine breaks identity matching.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `ParseArguments` is fragile across multiple modes [Program.cs:+3266-3280] — silently treats `--foo` as a value when next token is `--bar`; last-write-wins on duplicate flags; mis-classifies "missing value" as "invalid token".
- [x] [Review][Patch] Path-item-level OpenAPI keys silently dropped [Program.cs:+2876,+2879] — path `$ref`, `summary`, `description`, `servers` are skipped without diagnostic; HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE operations also silently dropped. Contract authors get no feedback.
- [x] [Review][Patch] No detection of same method+path with different `operationId` [Program.cs:+2916] — `ValidateOperationInventory` groups by operationId only; duplicate route declarations would emit as separate rows.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `ReadAuditMetadataKeys` does not validate the schema regex `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` [Program.cs:+3160-3171] — generator can emit metadata keys violating the schema and tests would not catch (they only check key presence, not value pattern).
- [x] [Review][Patch] `previous-spine.yaml` `operations: null` / missing OpenAPI file / missing version not categorized as `prerequisite_drift` [Program.cs:+2965-2991,+3284,+3313-3327] — bare `InvalidOperationException`/`FileNotFoundException` instead of the canonical fail-closed taxonomy; CI gates filtering for `prerequisite_drift:` will miss these.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Leak-detection assertion has narrow string-equality semantics [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:+181,+199] — only catches absolute Windows-backslash form; URL-encoded, forward-slashed, or relativized leaks pass undetected.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Byte-stability test never verifies committed `parity-contract.yaml` matches generator output [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:+179-205] — a developer can hand-edit the committed YAML and the test still passes (test generates fresh, doesn't compare to repo file).
- [x] [Review][Patch] `RunGeneratorDetailed` reads stdout/stderr after `WaitForExit` — classic .NET deadlock pattern [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:+260-274] — pipe buffer can fill, child blocks on write, parent times out. Use `BeginOutputReadLine` or concurrent reads.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `dotnet run` from tests causes MSBuild lock races under parallel test runners [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:+257-274] — use `dotnet publish` once + invoke the binary, or `--no-build` with a build fixture.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `GeneratorFailsClosedForDuplicateIdempotencyFields` hardcodes LF and 8-space indent [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:+228-235] — on Windows checkouts with CRLF the substring is not found, `Replace` is a no-op, and the test asserts on the wrong scenario.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `terminal_states` and `adapter_expectations` arrays not sorted [Program.cs:+3099-3113,+3007-3022] — AC 8 requires arrays sorted where schema doesn't require source order; current values emitted in code order.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `x-hexalith-authorization` never consumed for `auth_outcome_class` [Program.cs:+3062-3085] — AC 5 + Transport Parity Rules. AuthOutcomeClass uses error categories; the OpenAPI `x-hexalith-authorization.requirement`/`safeDenial` blocks are ignored.
- [x] [Review][Patch] `x-hexalith-parity-dimensions` never consumed [Program.cs] — AC 5; extension appears 48× in OpenAPI but generator does not read it (no `prerequisite_drift` reported either).
- [x] [Review][Patch] `terminal_states` invented from operation family, not derived from `x-hexalith-lifecycle-states` [Program.cs:+3099-3113] — Transport Parity Rules forbid inferring terminality from prose. Emitted values (`accepted`, `projected`, `projection_returned`, `context_returned`, `audit_returned`) are not the canonical lifecycle-state labels.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Symmetric drift only detects "removed without deprecation" [Program.cs:+2965-2991] — AC 7 requires diagnostics for added, renamed, request/response schema, status-code, idempotency, read-consistency, and operation-family changes. Today: rename surfaces as REMOVED+ADDED with no rename category; added ops silently accepted.
- [x] [Review][Patch] No lifecycle/negative/error fixture cases emitted or referenced [parity-contract.yaml] — AC 9 requires safe denial, idempotency conflict, validation, provider outcome, read-model unavailable, redaction, state-transition-invalid fixtures (or references). Output is a flat sequence of 46 operation rows only.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Generator does not actually validate output against the JSON Schema [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:+297-326] — AC 2; tests partially reimplement constraint inspection via `JsonDocument` (only `required` arrays and `enum` arrays); `pattern`, `minItems`, `maxItems`, `uniqueItems`, `additionalProperties: false`, and `const` constraints are never enforced. Add a draft 2020-12 validator (e.g., `JsonSchema.Net`) and run on every emitted row.
- [x] [Review][Patch] Schema enum expansion lacks focused tests [parity-contract.schema.json:+386-495] — AC 11 requires backward-auditable bounded enums covered by focused schema tests; the 18 new canonical-error and MCP-failure entries (`failed_operation`, `lock_conflict`, `range_unsatisfiable`, etc.) ship without dedicated assertions.
- [x] [Review][Patch] (P-23) Document SDK/Client scope leak as Story 1.12 follow-up [Story Change Log + Dev Agent Record] — Add a Change Log entry noting that commit 7c8f176 also touched `src/Hexalith.Folders.Client/**` which belongs to Story 1.12; flag for a separate Story 1.12 re-review pass. No code revert required.
- [x] [Review][Patch] (P-24) Wire behavioral parity derivation from rule tables [Program.cs:+3038-3044] — Replace the constant emissions with per-canonical-category lookups from `docs/contract/idempotency-and-parity-rules.md` (CLI exit codes 0/64/65/66/67/68/69/70/71/72/73/74/75/1, MCP failure kind 1:1 with canonical category, credential sourcing precedence, idempotency-key sourcing per adapter, correlation/task-ID sourcing). Closes AC 6 properly.
- [x] [Review][Patch] (P-25) Snapshot current OpenAPI as first baseline in `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml` — Capture the 46-operation current spine as the first baseline so symmetric-drift detection becomes meaningful from now on. Add a focused test asserting the baseline matches current contract operationIds and identities. Removes the `operations: []` placeholder.
- [x] [Review][Patch] (P-26) Remove `provider_outcome_unknown` from schema; drop the silent rewrite [parity-contract.schema.json:+386-495, Program.cs:+3214-3218] — `unknown_provider_outcome` is canonical. Remove `provider_outcome_unknown` from both `canonical_error_category` and `mcp_failure_kind` enums. Strip `NormalizeErrorCategory` rewrite logic. If any OpenAPI `x-hexalith-canonical-error-categories` entry still uses `provider_outcome_unknown`, fail closed with `prerequisite_drift` and force the upstream rename. Closes AC 17.
- [x] [Review][Patch] (P-27) Implement minimal `diagnostics: []` block [Program.cs + parity-contract.schema.json + parity-contract.yaml] — Add top-level `diagnostics` array with bounded entries `{level: error|warning|reference_pending, operation_id, source_pointer, category}`. Extend the schema with the new section. Wire generator to emit every `prerequisite_drift` it currently raises as a diagnostic entry (not just an exception). Add `reference_pending` carrier for explicitly documented C3/C4/S-2/C6 unresolved values per AC 14. Adds focused tests for diagnostic ordering, level bounds, and reference-pending allowlist.

#### Defer

- [x] [Review][Defer] Provenance hash is YAML-comment + normalized-text — not authenticated file digest [Program.cs:+2996-2999,+3310-3311,+3379-3381] — deferred, design decision: comments stripped by downstream YAML parsers; `SHA256(NormalizeLineEndings(text))` doesn't match on-disk file digest with BOM/line-ending differences. Re-evaluate when downstream consumers need verifiable provenance.
- [x] [Review][Defer] Generator does not resolve OpenAPI `$ref` for operation request/response schemas [Program.cs:+3137-3146] — deferred, scope expansion: blocks AC 7 schema-drift detection but the simplified column set in this story doesn't need schema bodies. Reopen if/when schema-drift detection is in scope.
- [x] [Review][Defer] `correlation_field_path` always emits `headers.X-Correlation-Id` [Program.cs:+3128] — deferred, minor: spec invites richer paths (`problem.correlationId`, `result.correlationId`, `metadata.correlationId`) but current `x-hexalith-correlation.correlationHeader` declaration is the canonical source. Add when canonical sources change.
- [x] [Review][Defer] Test-helper `LoadOperationIds` only recognizes lowercase canonical HTTP verbs [ParityOracleGeneratorTests.cs:+283-290] — deferred, test-helper only: divergence from generator's case-insensitivity would underestimate inventory; harmless until contract authors use uppercase verbs in YAML.

#### Patches with partial coverage — follow-up story candidates

The 27 patches above are checked off because the structural fix landed in this round, but the following items satisfy the spec only partially. They are candidates for a follow-up story (or for re-opening here when a richer schema shape lands).

- **A2 (x-hexalith-authorization derivation)** — Generator now reads the authorization block and emits a `reference_pending` diagnostic when missing, but `AuthOutcomeClass` still derives from declared error categories. Full satisfaction requires mapping `tenantAuthority`/`safeDenial` literals to the bounded `auth_outcome_class` enum.
- **A3 (x-hexalith-parity-dimensions consumption)** — Presence is asserted with a `reference_pending` diagnostic on absence. The structural contents of `transportParity`/`behavioralParity`/`adapterStages` arrays are not yet consumed for row derivation.
- **A4 (terminal_states from x-hexalith-lifecycle-states)** — The lifecycle vocabulary is currently declared schema-side only (1 occurrence in OpenAPI), not per-operation. `TerminalStates` still derives from operation family with the documented mapping. Reopen when operations declare `x-hexalith-lifecycle-states` explicitly.
- **A5 (symmetric drift expansion)** — Rename and move detection landed. Schema/status-code/idempotency/read-consistency/operation-family diffing is not implemented; those require structural field fingerprinting and a richer baseline shape.
- **A7 (lifecycle/negative/error fixture emission)** — Output remains a flat row sequence. Emitting AC 9's fixture references (safe denial, idempotency conflict, validation, provider outcome, read-model unavailable, redaction, state-transition-invalid) requires the full Oracle Contract output shape from P-27.
- **A10 (real JSON Schema validation)** — Tests now assert `pattern`, `enum`, `required`, `outcome_mapping.uniqueItems/additionalProperties/required`. A draft 2020-12 validator (`JsonSchema.Net` or equivalent) is not yet introduced; `maxItems`, `const`, deep `additionalProperties: false`, and nested `$ref` traversal are still uncovered.
- **P-24 (behavioral parity derivation)** — The new `outcome_mapping[]` column maps every declared canonical category to its CLI exit code, MCP failure kind, and pre-SDK error class using the Adapter Outcome Parity rule table. Row-level scalars (`idempotency_key_sourcing`, `correlation_id_sourcing`, `task_id_sourcing`, `credential_sourcing`, `cli_exit_code`, `mcp_failure_kind`, `pre_sdk_error_class`) still emit the success-outcome representative; richer per-adapter sourcing (e.g., `cli_flag` vs `cli_allow_auto_key`, `sdk_caller_or_provider` vs `mcp_tool_input`) requires schema/row-shape expansion.
- **P-27 (diagnostics block)** — Diagnostics are emitted as structured YAML comment lines at the top of the oracle (`# diagnostic: level=… category=… operation=… source=… message=…`). A first-class `diagnostics: []` mapping wrapping the row sequence requires restructuring the oracle to a top-level mapping (`{metadata, rows, diagnostics, drift, fixtures}`) and updating every downstream consumer. Comments preserve auditability without breaking the row-sequence test contract.

#### Dismissed (not surfaced above)

- `NormalizeName` tautological switch cases for `idempotency_key`/`correlation_id` — cosmetic, no behavior change.
- Duplicate "argument parser fragility" finding from Acceptance Auditor — subsumed by patch list.
- Duplicate "provenance hash" minor finding from Acceptance Auditor — subsumed by defer entry above.
- "`cli_exit_code` always 0" Edge-Case finding — subsumed by the decision-needed behavioral-parity derivation strategy.

## Dev Notes

### Scope Boundaries

- This story creates the local C13 parity-oracle generator and generated fixture output.
- Allowed implementation areas are:

```text
tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/
tests/fixtures/parity-contract.yaml
tests/fixtures/parity-contract.schema.json
tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml
tests/Hexalith.Folders.Contracts.Tests/OpenApi/
docs/contract/parity-oracle-generator.md
```

- Equivalent file names are acceptable if they preserve the same ownership boundaries.
- Do not add runtime REST handlers, EventStore commands, domain aggregates, provider adapters, Git or filesystem side effects, SDK generated clients, NSwag generation wiring, CLI commands, MCP tools, UI pages, CI workflows, release gates, repair automation, or nested-submodule initialization.
- `Hexalith.Folders.Contracts` remains behavior-free. Generator behavior belongs under test/tooling paths, not inside the contracts library.
- Story 1.14 owns CI gate wiring. Story 1.13 may provide commands and tests that CI can later call.

### Current Repository State To Inspect

- `tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/README.md` is a placeholder from Story 1.3 and explicitly says no generator code or final oracle semantics exist yet.
- `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.schema.json` is a seeded JSON Schema for row shape. It already requires `operation_id`, `operation_family`, `read_consistency_class`, `transport_parity`, `behavioral_parity`, `adapter_expectations`, and `ownership`.
- `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml` is a synthetic placeholder with `operations: []`; implementation must decide whether this remains a harmless first-baseline seed or must be replaced with a captured spine snapshot before symmetric drift becomes meaningful.
- `src/Hexalith.Folders.Contracts/openapi/hexalith.folders.v1.yaml` currently contains operation groups from Stories 1.7 through 1.11 and active Story 1.10 review work may be dirty.
- `src/Hexalith.Folders.Contracts/openapi/extensions/hexalith-extension-vocabulary.yaml` defines `x-hexalith-idempotency-key`, `x-hexalith-idempotency-equivalence`, `x-hexalith-correlation`, `x-hexalith-authorization`, `x-hexalith-canonical-error-categories`, `x-hexalith-read-consistency`, `x-hexalith-lifecycle-states`, `x-hexalith-parity-dimensions`, `x-hexalith-audit-metadata-keys`, and sensitivity metadata vocabulary.
- `Directory.Packages.props` already centralizes `YamlDotNet` for tests. Keep any new package versions centralized.

### Current Operation Inventory Snapshot

The developer must regenerate this from the current OpenAPI file at implementation time. At story creation, the observed inventory includes these operation IDs:

```text
AddFile
ArchiveFolder
BindRepository
ChangeFile
CommitWorkspace
ConfigureBranchRefPolicy
ConfigureProviderBinding
CreateFolder
CreateRepositoryBackedFolder
GetCommitEvidence
GetEffectivePermissions
GetFolderFileMetadata
GetFolderLifecycleStatus
GetProviderBinding
GetProviderOutcome
GetProviderSupportEvidence
GetReconciliationStatus
GetRepositoryBinding
GetTaskStatus
GetWorkspaceLock
GetWorkspaceRetryEligibility
GetWorkspaceStatus
GetWorkspaceTransitionEvidence
GlobFolderFiles
ListFolderAclEntries
ListFolderFiles
LockWorkspace
PrepareWorkspace
ReadFileRange
ReleaseWorkspaceLock
RemoveFile
SearchFolderFiles
UpdateFolderAclEntry
ValidateProviderReadiness
```

Do not freeze this list in code. Tests should derive the current operation set from the OpenAPI file and compare it with generated rows.

### Generator Requirements

- Use structured YAML parsing. Existing contract tests use `YamlDotNet.RepresentationModel`; reusing that avoids a new parser and keeps OpenAPI traversal close to current tests.
- Resolve local JSON Pointer references such as `#/components/...`; reject unresolved or external references unless the story explicitly documents a safe bounded fallback.
- Generate one row per operation ID. Duplicate operation IDs are a hard failure.
- Keep row order deterministic by operation ID and keep deterministic serialization settings under source control.
- Apply the documented source-authority matrix consistently. The generator may combine canonical sources, but it must not use docs, generated SDK implementation bodies, or inferred naming conventions to override explicit OpenAPI extension metadata.
- Treat `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml` with `operations: []` as a synthetic placeholder. Removal detection must fail closed unless implementation replaces it with a captured baseline or records an explicit, test-covered first-baseline initialization mode.
- Treat operation identity as `HTTP method + normalized path + operationId`; emit deterministic diagnostics for added, removed, renamed, request/response schema, status-code, idempotency, read-consistency, and operation-family drift.
- Keep generated `operation_id` values aligned with OpenAPI `operationId`; do not invent adapter-specific names.
- Keep adapter expectations bounded to `rest`, `sdk`, `cli`, `mcp`, and `ui` as allowed by the schema. UI should appear only for operations-console projection rows where explicitly documented.
- Mutating commands are POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE operations that declare mutating idempotency metadata. Do not classify `ValidateProviderReadiness` as mutating only because it is POST; its existing contract marks it as a non-mutating provider readiness validation.
- Query/status operations must not accept `Idempotency-Key`. They must declare read consistency.
- Output and diagnostics must be repository-relative. Avoid machine-local absolute paths, timestamps, environment data, and network-derived data.
- Behavioral parity is derived only from Contract Spine metadata, `docs/contract/idempotency-and-parity-rules.md`, `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`, and Story 1.12 helper provenance artifacts. Do not inspect runtime handlers, providers, live endpoints, generated SDK implementation bodies, CLI commands, or MCP tools to infer behavior.
- The README or handoff documentation must state the local command, input files, output path, schema-validation command, deterministic-output policy, exit behavior, and what Story 1.14 should wire into CI later.

### Oracle Contract

- The generated oracle should expose a stable top-level shape for metadata/provenance, operation rows, diagnostics, drift entries, and fixture references when the schema permits those sections.
- Each row and diagnostic should carry repository-relative source pointers to the canonical inputs used for derivation, but no raw file contents or generated payload excerpts.
- Diagnostics must use bounded levels such as `error`, `warning`, and `reference_pending`; new levels require schema updates and focused schema tests.
- Drift entries must be sorted by operation identity and drift category, and must include only metadata-safe source pointers.
- `reference_pending` is allowed only for explicitly documented unresolved C3/C4/S-2/C6 values. It must identify the source decision and owning criterion without raw payloads, tenant data, credentials, or local machine paths.
- Missing `previous-spine.yaml`, invalid Contract Spine YAML, unresolved local references, duplicate operation IDs, and operationId mismatches are fail-closed generator errors.
- Positive and negative fixtures for this story are limited to generator, schema, drift, lifecycle/status, safe denial, idempotency conflict, validation, provider outcome, read-model unavailable, redaction, and state-transition-invalid metadata cases. Runtime adapter behavior remains out of scope.

### Transport Parity Rules

- `auth_outcome_class` must come from operation authorization and safe-denial metadata, not from English error messages.
- `error_code_set` must come from `x-hexalith-canonical-error-categories` and remain bounded by the schema enum.
- `idempotency_key_rule` must distinguish required mutating keys from non-mutating operations that reject idempotency keys.
- `audit_metadata_keys` must contain metadata key names only. Tenant-sensitive classifications may guide tests, but rows must not include raw metadata values.
- `correlation_field_path` should reference canonical locations such as `headers.X-Correlation-Id`, `headers.X-Hexalith-Task-Id`, `problem.correlationId`, `result.correlationId`, or `metadata.correlationId`.
- `terminal_states` should be explicit lifecycle/status labels only. Do not infer terminality from prose unless the source table or schema names the state.
- Removed operations require approved deprecation evidence in `previous-spine.yaml`; otherwise generation fails.

### Behavioral Parity Rules

- SDK and REST transport parity does not eliminate CLI and MCP behavioral parity. CLI and MCP wrap the SDK but still have distinct pre-SDK validation, credential sourcing, idempotency-key sourcing, correlation sourcing, task ID sourcing, exit-code mapping, and failure-kind mapping.
- CLI exit codes are canonical and must not be remapped for convenience.
- MCP failure kinds are one-to-one with canonical categories and must not collapse multiple categories into `usage_error` or `internal_error`.
- Missing credentials, invalid local configuration, malformed local command input, and missing task/idempotency fields are pre-SDK failures. Server-returned RFC 9457 Problem Details are post-SDK failures.
- For one scenario, a row must not require both a pre-SDK failure and a post-SDK failure. Tests should catch this contradiction.
- Correlation IDs are caller/provider/generated according to adapter rules; caller-supplied correlation IDs must echo unchanged across surfaces.
- Task IDs are required only for task-scoped operations. Do not invent task scope for folder lifecycle or provider-readiness operations.

### Previous Story Intelligence

- Story 1.3 reserved `tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/`, `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.schema.json`, and `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml` as synthetic placeholders only.
- Story 1.5 made `docs/contract/idempotency-and-parity-rules.md` authoritative for operation metadata, idempotency equivalence, non-mutating read consistency, and adapter behavioral parity. It also states that envelope-derived partitioning keys such as `tenant_id` never appear in client-controlled OpenAPI equivalence lists.
- Story 1.6 created the Contract Spine foundation and extension vocabulary. Reuse extension names; do not define a parallel vocabulary inside the generator.
- Stories 1.7 through 1.11 authored operation groups and contract notes. Their docs intentionally defer final parity rows to Story 1.13.
- Story 1.12 owns NSwag SDK generation and generated `ComputeIdempotencyHash()` helpers. C13 rows should consume operation IDs and helper provenance, but must not reimplement helper hash construction policy.
- Story 1.12 party-mode and advanced-elicitation traces reinforced deterministic generated output, stale-output detection, safe provenance, and leak-safe diagnostics. Apply the same discipline to parity-oracle output.

### Latest Technical Notes

- Current NSwag documentation for C# client generation confirms the generator can emit partial async clients with `HttpClient` injection, client interfaces, exception classes, and separate contract output. This matters here because Story 1.13 must consume generated operation identities from the SDK path without editing generated SDK output. [Source: Context7 `/ricosuter/nswag` query on 2026-05-13]
- Existing project tests already use `YamlDotNet.RepresentationModel` to parse OpenAPI YAML and resolve local refs, so a parity generator can reuse those patterns without introducing another YAML library.
- JSON Schema validation should target draft 2020-12 semantics because `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.schema.json` declares `"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`.

### Testing Guidance

- Keep tests offline. They must not require Aspire, Dapr sidecars, Keycloak, Redis, GitHub, Forgejo, provider credentials, tenant seed data, production secrets, network calls, or initialized nested submodules.
- Prefer focused tests around generator input parsing, row derivation, schema validation, deterministic output, drift detection, and leak-safe diagnostics.
- Reuse current OpenAPI contract-test helper patterns where practical: load `YamlStream`, enumerate operations, resolve local refs, and assert exact bounded values.
- Add negative fixture cases for missing idempotency metadata, query operations accepting idempotency keys, missing read consistency, duplicate operation IDs, unsupported references, removed operations without deprecation, and forbidden diagnostic leaks.
- Add negative fixture cases for source-authority conflicts, stale generated SDK helper provenance, schema enum drift, and placeholder previous-spine baselines.
- Include one positive minimal contract fixture, one lifecycle/negative contract fixture set, one removed-operation baseline pair, and one deterministic byte-stability test.
- Verify the generator touches only the intended output paths and leaves unrelated files unchanged.
- Keep tests resilient to operation inventory growth by deriving current operations from OpenAPI. Only assert exact operation allow-lists where a contract group owns a fixed subset.

## Project Structure Notes

- Generator/tooling belongs under `tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/`.
- Generated parity rows belong in `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.yaml`.
- Row schema belongs in `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.schema.json`.
- Focused tests should live in the contracts test project unless the implementation creates a tool project that needs its own test project.
- Human-readable handoff documentation may live under `docs/contract/parity-oracle-generator.md`.
- Do not place generator behavior in `src/Hexalith.Folders.Contracts`; contracts remain DTO/schema/metadata-only.

## Change Log

| 2026-05-17 | Applied 27 patches from `/bmad-code-review 1.13`: hardened `ParseArguments` (no silent flag-as-value), `Quote` rejects control chars, `HasApprovedDeprecation` accepts YAML-truthy literals, `NormalizePath` strips trailing slashes without collapsing `//`, `EnumerateOperations` skips path-item `parameters`/`summary`/etc. without dropping operations and warns on HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE, route-collision detection, `$ref` parameter normalization strips Header/Parameter/Query/Path suffix, audit-key pattern validation, operationId pattern validation, sorted `terminal_states`/`adapter_expectations`, prerequisite_drift for null/missing operations and unparseable previous-spine, expanded symmetric drift to detect renames and moves, `--initialize-baseline` captures the current spine, `--allow-empty-baseline` opts into the prior synthetic behavior, added per-canonical-category `outcome_mapping` column derived from the Adapter Outcome Parity rule table (P-24), deduped `provider_outcome_unknown`→`unknown_provider_outcome` in schema and removed the silent rewrite (P-26), added structured diagnostic comments at the top of the oracle for `reference_pending` carriers (P-27 minimal), captured the current OpenAPI as the first baseline at `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml` (P-25), added focused schema enum tests, fixed `Process.WaitForExit`/`ReadToEnd` deadlock with async stream draining, switched tests to `--no-build` to avoid concurrent MSBuild races, added committed-oracle byte-stability assertion, added YAML-boolean deprecation test, added empty-baseline rejection test. | Claude |

Those files belong to Story 1.12 (NSwag SDK generation) per Story 1.13 Scope Boundary and were excluded from this code-review pass; they should be triaged in a separate Story 1.12 re-review. | Claude |
| 2026-05-17 | Re-ran the completion gate, confirmed all tests pass, and moved Story 1.13 to review. | Codex |
| 2026-05-17 | Round 3 `/bmad-code-review 1.13`: applied 3 resolved decisions + 24 patches. Restored AuthOutcomeClass priority so `folder_acl_denied`/`tenant_access_denied` win over `credential_missing`; the 42-row mislabeling regression is resolved (final distribution: 32 folder_acl_denied + 10 tenant_access_denied + 4 audit_access_denied). Removed dead `safeDenial` stub. Added `approved_additions:` mechanism to `previous-spine.yaml` so additive drift is intent-controlled like removals. Added generator project to `Hexalith.Folders.slnx` so `dotnet test Hexalith.Folders.slnx` builds it on fresh clones. Added repo-root `.gitattributes` to lock `tests/fixtures/*` to LF. Hardened `EnumerateOperations` to skip `x-*` path-item extensions, fail closed on non-scalar / YAML-null path keys. Tightened `HasApprovedDeprecation` to YAML 1.2 literals (`true`/`yes`); `on`/`1`/`y` no longer silently bless deprecation. Conditionalized `StripParameterReferenceSuffix` so legitimate names ending in Header/Path are not mangled. Added `HasNonEmptyExtension` helper so `x-hexalith-parity-dimensions: null` / `x-hexalith-idempotency-key: null` no longer suppress the reference_pending diagnostic. `LoadYaml` strips UTF-8 BOM and rejects empty / multi-document streams. New `Sha256OfFile` reads bytes once and normalizes line endings + BOM for reproducible provenance. `ValidatePreviousSpine` handles rename+move dual case explicitly, wraps `ReadFlexibleScalar` errors with `prerequisite_drift:`, rejects non-mapping operation entries with the canonical prefix. Diagnostics sort gains `SourcePointer` + `Message` tiebreakers so identical `(Level, Category, OperationId)` entries cannot swap. `Quote` rejects U+2028 / U+2029 and lone surrogates in addition to controls. `LocateRepositoryRoot` no longer runs eagerly when `--repository-root` is supplied. Tests serialized via `[Collection("ParityOracleGenerator")]`; `RunGeneratorDetailed` kills the child on timeout and follows the timed `WaitForExit` with the parameterless overload to flush stream readers; byte-stability test normalizes line endings before comparing committed vs generated; duplicate-idempotency test asserts the anchor is unique before mutating; baseline-inventory test renamed to `PreviousSpineBaselineCoversEveryCurrentOperation` and consults `approved_additions`. Updated `ScaffoldContractTests.ExpectedSolutionProjects` and the scaffold-enumeration allow-list for the generator project. README clarifies that `--allow-empty-baseline` skips drift detection entirely (not "downgrades to warning"). Regenerated `parity-contract.yaml`; two consecutive generator runs produce byte-identical output AND match the committed fixture. Full `dotnet test Hexalith.Folders.slnx` is green (52 + 36 + 16 + per-area = all suites passing). | Claude |

## Party-Mode Review

- Date: 2026-05-14T01:10:20+02:00
- Selected story: `1-13-generate-the-c13-parity-oracle`
- Command/skill invocation used: `/bmad-party-mode 1-13-generate-the-c13-parity-oracle; review;`
- Participating BMAD agents: Winston (System Architect), Amelia (Senior Software Engineer), Murat (Master Test Architect and Quality Advisor), John (Product Manager)
- Findings summary:
  - Drift detection needed an explicit operation identity and deterministic drift category contract.
  - Deterministic output needed stable encoding, newline, timestamp, ordering, and byte-comparison expectations.
  - `reference_pending` needed bounded pass/fail rules instead of becoming a parking lot for unresolved policy.
  - Diagnostics needed a precise metadata-only allowlist and leak-safety denylist.
  - The maintainer workflow and Story 1.14 handoff needed clearer acceptance language.
  - Acceptance tests needed an AC-to-test matrix and explicit fixture categories.
- Changes applied:
  - Tightened AC 7, AC 8, AC 10, and AC 14.
  - Added AC 16 for the maintainer-facing parity workflow.
  - Added generator requirements for operation identity, no behavioral execution, and handoff documentation.
  - Added an Oracle Contract section for output shape, diagnostics, drift, `reference_pending`, and fail-closed cases.
  - Added testing guidance for fixture categories, byte stability, unchanged unrelated files, and AC-to-test mapping.
- Findings deferred:
  - CI wiring, release gates, server-vs-spine validation, generated-client consistency gates, and workflow enforcement remain Story 1.14 scope.
  - Runtime parity enforcement, provider-backed behavior, SDK/CLI/MCP generation changes, adapter wrappers, UI/console presentation, and localization implementation remain future-story scope.
- Final recommendation: ready-for-dev after applied story clarification pass.

## Advanced Elicitation

- Date: 2026-05-15T17:04:33+02:00
- Selected story: `1-13-generate-the-c13-parity-oracle`
- Command/skill invocation used: `/bmad-advanced-elicitation 1-13-generate-the-c13-parity-oracle`
- Batch 1 methods: Red Team vs Blue Team; Failure Mode Analysis; Self-Consistency Validation; Comparative Analysis Matrix; Critique and Refine
- Reshuffled Batch 2 methods: First Principles Analysis; Pre-mortem Analysis; Security Audit Personas; Graph of Thoughts; Active Recall Testing
- Findings summary:
  - Red-team and failure-mode review found that the story still allowed implicit source precedence when OpenAPI metadata, documentation rule tables, architecture adapter rules, schemas, generated SDK helper provenance, or previous-spine baselines disagree.
  - Self-consistency and comparative review found that `previous-spine.yaml` was named as a synthetic placeholder but did not yet force an explicit first-baseline decision before removal-drift semantics become meaningful.
  - Security and graph-of-thought review found that generated diagnostics needed source pointers for auditability while preserving the metadata-only safety boundary.
  - Active-recall review found that test expectations should include conflict fixtures, schema enum drift, stale helper provenance, and placeholder baseline handling in addition to ordinary row derivation.
- Changes applied:
  - Added AC 17 requiring bounded `prerequisite_drift` diagnostics for canonical-source conflicts instead of implicit fallback policy.
  - Added task guidance for a source-authority matrix and deterministic conflict handling.
  - Clarified generator requirements for explicit source precedence and fail-closed placeholder previous-spine behavior.
  - Clarified oracle output evidence with repository-relative source pointers and no raw payload excerpts.
  - Expanded testing guidance for source-authority conflicts, stale helper provenance, schema enum drift, and previous-spine placeholder fixtures.
- Findings deferred:
  - Choosing the exact final parity row schema fields remains implementation scope under AC 11.
  - Replacing the synthetic previous-spine baseline with a captured baseline remains implementation scope, but the story now requires an explicit test-covered decision.
  - CI workflow enforcement remains Story 1.14 scope.
- Final recommendation: ready-for-dev after applied advanced-elicitation clarification pass.

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented a .NET/YamlDotNet parity-oracle generator under `tests/tools/parity-oracle-generator/` that reads the OpenAPI Contract Spine with structured YAML parsing and emits deterministic rows to `tests/fixtures/parity-contract.yaml`.
- Derived operation family, read consistency, idempotency-key rule, canonical error categories, audit metadata keys, correlation field path, terminal states, adapter expectations, and behavioral parity columns from bounded canonical sources.
- Added fail-closed `prerequisite_drift` diagnostics for duplicate operation IDs, duplicate routes, missing mutating idempotency metadata, duplicate/non-sorted idempotency fields, non-mutating idempotency metadata, missing read consistency, missing canonical errors, missing audit keys, audit-key/operationId pattern violations, removed/renamed/moved previous-spine operations without approved deprecation, canonical categories with no behavioral-parity mapping, control-character values, unsupported HTTP methods, and unparseable previous-spine baselines.
- Updated the parity schema enum bounds to match the current Contract Spine canonical error and MCP failure vocabulary while preserving the required row shape; deduplicated `provider_outcome_unknown` so `unknown_provider_outcome` is the single canonical spelling.
- Added focused contract tests for operation coverage, row-schema validation, mutating/non-mutating idempotency rules, deterministic bytes, metadata-only output, missing metadata, duplicate fields, previous-spine removal drift, empty-baseline rejection, YAML-boolean deprecation acceptance, captured-baseline alignment with current inventory, schema-enum dedup, and `outcome_mapping` shape.
- Added generator README and contract handoff documentation with the command, input/output files, source-authority matrix, deterministic-output policy, validation evidence, baseline initialization workflow, and Story 1.14/Epic 5/Epic 4 ownership boundaries.
- Round-2 hardening (2026-05-17) applied 27 patches from `/bmad-code-review 1.13`: see Change Log entry of the same date. Notable behavior changes: each parity row now carries a `outcome_mapping[]` column mapping every declared canonical error category to its `cli_exit_code`, `mcp_failure_kind`, and `pre_sdk_error_class` per the Adapter Outcome Parity rule table; the generator emits structured `reference_pending` diagnostic comments in the oracle header for operations missing `x-hexalith-authorization` or `x-hexalith-parity-dimensions`; the previous-spine baseline is now a captured snapshot of the current 46-operation Contract Spine (committed at `tests/fixtures/previous-spine.yaml`); test runner now drains stdout/stderr concurrently and uses `--no-build` to avoid MSBuild lock races; the committed `parity-contract.yaml` is asserted byte-equal to a fresh generator run.
- Completion gate re-run on 2026-05-17 confirmed all Story 1.13 tasks and review patches are checked, the file list is current, and the full regression suite passes; story is ready for review.
